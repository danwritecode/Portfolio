                <h2>HOW I DISPEL FEAR</h2>
                <p>Fear is something that humans have in order not to get eaten by a tiger, starve in the middle of winter or roast in the desert under the sun. It’s a mechanism our bodies have to alert us of danger. To alert us when our calm peaceful existence is threatened in any way.</p>
                <p>Today that response has evolved to warn us of decisions or situations that might cause us to lose our livelihoods or to displace us in social standings. It warns you to not leave your job because that income is giving you food and it warns you to not speak your mind as to not lose a foothold with somebody important in society.</p>
                <p>But here’s the secret; we don’t really need our bodies to warn us of most things that aren’t physically life threatening. We can very safely ignore many of these signals our bodies transmit via chemicals in our bloodstream. Why? Because we’re not going to die if we quit our jobs and our lives are not threatened by jeopardizing a relationship from being true to our principles.</p>
                <p>This sounds like it should be easy, to simply ignore this, but it absolutely isn’t. You constantly have to put your mind somewhere where it can find perspective, where it can remember that you are not going to die from this decision and that you have absolute freedom over this world and the universe.</p>
                <p>We all are the offspring of something we do not understand. Our existence is unbelievably improbable and equally remarkable. The fact that this world and universe exists is enough of a reason to push fear aside. We are miracles of the universe, why should we be afraid to take risk? We are here for a finite amount of time, why should we not try to wield the power that the universe has granted us? We have incredible minds that are made of the same molecules that make up our planet and the stars, the difference is our molecules have somehow assembled themselves in a way that allow us to think. Take advantage of that “somehow” and wield the power that we are given to change humanity. Elevate your mind to sit alongside the universe and you will no longer feel fear.</p>
