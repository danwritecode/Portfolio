                <h2>PROBLEMS BEFORE SOLUTIONS</h2>
                <p>For a second imagine that the person who invented the firehose believed that the firehose should be used for everything. Their passion for their invention was so great that they wanted to apply the firehose to every problem that involved water. Plumbing for a house? Firehose. Need to water your garden? Firehose. Need to extinguish a small grease fire? Firehose.</p>
                <p>This sounds ridiculous, obviously. That’s because the solutions that correctly correspond to their problems have already been solved for the examples I’ve given above. We know now that the firehose is correctly tasked to extinguishing very large house or building fires, not for plumbing or watering your petunias.</p>
                <p>But what about problems that we don’t already have solutions for? When the pairing of problem and solution is not so clear, it’s easy to attempt to apply a novel solution anywhere that it sort of fits even if it’s not a perfect fit.</p>
                <p>This is why it’s important to take the solution that you want to immediately apply to a problem, take it out back, shoot it and then bury it 15 feet underground. Immediately jumping to conclusions and applying solutions to problems is how you get stuck with broken processes or terrible products. Instead, think about the problem first, fight against your brain while it tries to jump to conclusions. Take the problem for what it is and think about the absolute simplest/most practical way to solve that problem with the information you have available to you.</p>
                <p>Implying this method of thinking will ensure that firehoses don’t water gardens or plumb houses. It will also ensure that you don’t invent shit processes or products that have no fit and are not needed.</p>
