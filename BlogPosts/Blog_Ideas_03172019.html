                <h2>IDEATION</h2>
                <p>Ideas are a fundamental part of what makes us human. Without ideas humans would be nothing. Ideas are what separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom on earth. They are what has allowed us to evolve over millions of years into the species that we are today. With incredible technology, incredible devices, incredible physical constructions.</p>
                <p>But how do great ideas come to fruition in an age where it seems so many of the great ideas are taken? Well I think there are several things here:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>All great ideas are not taken. As humanity evolves, so does our technology and so do our lives. This opens doors to an infinite number of new ideas.</li>
                    <li>People who are able to think of great ideas are also able to quickly run those ideas through a very fast mental audit. They can very quickly determine if an idea is worth any more thought or if the idea should be abandoned all together.</li>
                    <li>Starting from the problem and not the solution is key. As a technologist I love new technology products. I want to integrate that product everywhere I look. This is the wrong way to go about both ideation and problem solving. Abandon the solution and focus on what the problem is, at first.</li>
                    <li>Ideation requires an individual to abandon all physical and social constructs. Breaking a problem down into it's component atoms is the best way to find the simplest solution. It's also the least intimidating way to go about problem solving.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Go find new ideas. Bring new life to the world. Remember that an idea can spawn something into existence that did not exist previously. This is an incredible and exciting super power that we have.</p>
