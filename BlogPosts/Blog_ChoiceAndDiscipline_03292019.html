                <h2>CHOICE AND DISCIPLINE</h2>
                <p>Recently I changed to a low carb diet consisting of red meat and lots of vegetables. I made the decision to do this based on evidence of thousands of anecdotal (and sometimes imperial) accounts of other individuals partaking in this form of dieting. Their experience generally went like this: I have more energy, I lost weight.</p>
                <p>With this data in hand, I set out to instill the discipline upon myself that would allow me to lose weight and have more energy. Doing this took trust in others experiences. I knew based on data that if I didn’t deviate from my diet that I would see changes. Four months later I can say the data was not wrong.</p>
                <p>But what about in situations where we don’t yet have the data required to know that self-discipline will yield positive results? Is there untapped human potential in choosing (accurately) to be disciplined in areas that have not yet seen the benefits of unforgiving discipline? Can we use discipline as a tool to discover new things? Doing so requires a leap of faith, it requires an individual to have incredible judgement to decide how long to persist and when to stop.</p>
                <P>The individuals who take this leap of faith are the ones who are able to add to this world. They are embarking down a path that has no data. But if they find success, the data they yield will empower others to confidently take that same path. This is the key to all human growth and without our ability to choose and stay disciplined in the face of uncertainty, we would be unable to create anything. This is our fundamental superpower.</P>
